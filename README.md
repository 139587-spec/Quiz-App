Hi!! This project is a simple quiz app that integrates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is pretty basic, but I wanted to broaden my experience by creating something that was not static. This is a software/coding 
like quiz that tests your skills on basic code terminology. I added a timer and a time-bar at the top of the page so that you can keep time. There are animations and many CSS styles that I used to make this
website come alive. This is around my 8th project and I hope to keep getting better and hopefully create my dream, which is a full-blown RPG soon! Until I drop that, hope you enjoy this project!!
